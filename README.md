# Calculator
A multipurpose calculator


Ver 0.7: Added equals functionality, including the ability to perform an operation based on the previous computation. Also added the ability to find the exponent of two numbers and to use a decimal point.  Next step is to allow an operator to show the answer in order to chain operators together.

Ver 0.8: Increased the size and weight of the font on the buttons. Simplified code by removing redundant functions. Added the ability to chain operators, but created a bug that swaps the operator with another if you click on a different operator.

Ver 0.9 Corrected chaining operators together. Error when hitting equals multiple times.

Ver 0.9.5 Erased a lot of convoluted code and redid most of the functions. Cleaned up the code.  Minor CSS improvements. Out for testing before final implementation.

Ver 0.9.6 Added Ver number in header of page.

Ver 0.9.7 Added upper and lower displays.  Upper display will show previous equation entered.  Also fixed some internal logic that stored variables incorrectly.  Also set display to handle nine digits before maxing out to prevent overrun of display.  Fixed some minor bugs involving overrun of the display (the y in infinity, scientific notation, etc).

Ver 0.9.8 Removed the ability to put in multiple decimal points.  Added comments inside code.

Ver 0.9.9 Added backspace and square root buttons.  Changed size of buttons in CSS to fit extra buttons.

Ver 1.0 Added functionality for backspace and square root functions.  Changed multiplication button from * to x. 

Ver 1.1 Changed size of the upper display to better fit the screen.

Ver 1.1.1 Changed version number on page.

Ver 1.1.2 Changed lower display to not cut off upper display on mobile devices.

Ver 1.2 Fixed possible NaN error when taking the square root of a negative number. Fixed possible NaN error when performing an operation on an existing error.
