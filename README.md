A multipurpose calculator


Ver 0.7: Added equals functionality, including the ability to perform an operation based on the previous computation. Also added the ability to find the exponent of two numbers and to use a decimal point.  Next step is to allow an operator to show the answer in order to chain operators together.

Ver 0.8: Increased the size and weight of the font on the buttons. Simplified code by removing redundant functions. Added the ability to chain operators, but created a bug that swaps the operator with another if you click on a different operator.

Ver 0.9 Corrected chaining operators together. Error when hitting equals multiple times.
